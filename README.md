# SystemsHW2

We used two programs to determine cache size. [Stepper.c](\stepper.c) steps through a buffer with the formula j := (3*j + 7). Then the value at buffer[j] is written to a dummy variable. The [model2](\model2.c) algorithm initializes by creating a buffer with entries [0,1,2,...,254,255,0,1,2,...], and then shuffling it. The buffer is then accessed by randomly picking a 256-sized block of the buffer and accessing the nth value in the block, where n starts with zero and is set to the value of the previously accessed byte with each iteration. 

Both programs implement background subtraction by repeating all of the operations except for the read from memory. The duration of the repeat is subtracted from the duration of the original. 

Both programs demonstrated a clear jump in time per write at 2^18 kilobytes (260 megabytes). Model2 also demonstrates a jump at 256 kilobytes. The jump takes place between the 128 and 512 kB ranges. The continuous nature of the jump could be due to half the buffer fitting in the cache while the other half remains uncached.

Cpuid was run [(cpuid.c)](\cpuid.c) and produced the following results [(cpuid.txt).](\cpuid.txt):
5A	Data TLB0: 2Mb or 4MB pages, 4-way set associative, 32 entries
03	Data TLB: 4 KB pages, 4-way set associative, 64 entries
76	Instruction TLB: 2M/4M pages, fully associative, 8 entries
B0	Instruction TLB: 4KB pages, fully associative, 32 entries
F0	64B prefetching
CA	Shared 2nd level TLB: 4KB page, 4-way associative, 512 entries
